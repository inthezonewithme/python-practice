#1 Sum all elements in a list
The simple function takes in a list(array) as its parameter and iterates through it adding the elements together
Example usage with the list[1,2,3,4,5]

#2 Even or Odd#
Uses the modulo operator to check the remainder of dividing the number by 2 and prints the result

#3 Factorial
Multiply each decremental number from an argument n up to 1 in a loop then returns the factorial which is then output to the console

#4 Reverse a String
The function works by passing in a word, which is then converted to a list 
Another list, reversed_word is them initialised with 'none' values and then populated with the elements of the list of word.
The reversed_word elements are then joined together using the join() method

#5 Factorial(with recursion)
Has a base case that terminates the recursive calls as n is multiplied by its decrement
